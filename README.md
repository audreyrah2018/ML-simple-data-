Create a simple program from simple data (Supervised Learning) to help the user to know how to train a linear model using Perceptron, and evaluate the performance by printing f1 score, confusion matrix and classification report, RandomForest Classifier and finally build and train model by Lightgbm modeling in which auc_scores is calculated since the data is numeral one finally features importance codes applied to rank important features.
